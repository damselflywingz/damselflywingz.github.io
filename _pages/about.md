About Me
======

I am a 38-year-old white settler living and working on the traditional Territory of the lək̓ʷəŋən speaking peoples. I acknowledge and give thanks to the lessons and teachings I have received while living and working here in Victoria, BC. As a scientist, and in my work in the natural resource management sector of the BC Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy I am committed to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada's Call to Action and upholding the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Current Research: epigenetic interference in SARS-CoV-2
======

My research explores the molecular evolution of epigenetic interference as an anti-host mechanism in RNA viruses. Leveraging advanced strategies in RNA-sequencing, integrative bioinformatics, and functional genetics, I hope my research will provide the missing link to fight back against emerging zoonotic diseases like SARS-CoV-2.
