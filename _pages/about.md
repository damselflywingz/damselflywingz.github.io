About Me
======

I am a white settler living and working on the traditional Territory of the lək̓ʷəŋən speaking peoples. I acknowledge and give thanks to the lessons and teachings I have received while living and working here in Victoria, BC. As a scientist, and in my work in the natural resource management sector of the BC Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy I am committed to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada's Call to Action and upholding the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Current Research: epigenetic interference in SARS-CoV-2
======

My current research explores the molecular evolution of epigenetic interference as an anti-host mechanism in RNA viruses. With support from the Michael Smith Labs - Health Research BC Training Fellowship, I am leveraging advanced strategies in RNA-sequencing, integrative bioinformatics, and functional genetics, in hopes that the research will provide the missing link to fight back against emerging zoonotic RNA viruses, like SARS-CoV-2. 

Past Research: Tick microbiome
======

Previously, as a postdoc with Dr. Rob Colautti at Queen's University (2020 - 2021), where I use high-throughput genetic sequencing to understand threat of emerging pathogens within blacklegged ticks - <i>Ixodes scapularis</i>, including <i>Rickettsia buchneri</i>, Lyme disease borreliosis group <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> and RNA viruses. I have developed an open-source R pipeline for analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing for bacteria associated with ticks.

Past Research: In vivo transcriptome Yersinia
======

I was a New Zealand Commonwealth Fellow for my PhD, completed with Dr. Mark Hurst at AgResearch Ltd. New Zealand., where I worked on transcriptome of entomopathogenic bacterium <i>Yersinia entomophaga</i>.
