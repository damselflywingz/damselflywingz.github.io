I am a PhD Candidate at Worcester Polytechnic Institute with an expected graduation May 2022. My PhD research is part of the [Emutivo](https://emutivo.wpi.edu) project advised by Prof Elke Rundensteiner. Specifically, my research involves screening for mental illnesses with text data collected using mobile applications. My research interests include machine learning, visualization, health informatics, generative modeling, unsupervised learning, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction. I am a mental health advocate who enjoys writing, solving puzzles, and hiking with my dog Bumper.
